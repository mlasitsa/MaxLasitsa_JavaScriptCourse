/* 
UNIT 1: CONSOLE.LOG
- The 'console' is an object provided by JavaScript environments (like browsers and Node.js) that offers various methods for debugging purposes.
- 'log' is one of the methods of the 'console' object. It is used to output information to the console.
- '.' (dot notation) is used in JavaScript to access properties or methods of an object.
- '()' indicates the invocation of a function or method. When we use 'console.log()', we are calling the 'log' method of the 'console' object.
- 'Hello World' is a string argument passed to the 'log' method. In JavaScript, strings can be enclosed in backticks (`), single quotes ('), or double quotes (").

Other useful console methods include:
- console.dir(): Displays an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object.
- console.table(): Displays tabular data as a table. Useful for viewing arrays or objects in a structured format.
